h1. fusion-tables

This API lets you easily interact with Google Fusion Tables from your Ruby application.

h2. Installation

gem install fusion_tables

h2. To Use

bq.
require 'fusion_tables'

or in Rails 2.3.x

bq.
config.gem 'fusion_tables'

h2. API examples
 
The best place to see examples of uploading KML is in the tests, but this is a good starting point.

<pre><code>
# Connect to service	
@ft = GData::Client::FusionTables.new      
@ft.clientlogin(username, password)

# Create a new table
# Configure the columns you want
cols = [{:name => "friend name",    :datatype => 'string' },
        {:name => "age",            :datatype => 'number' },
        {:name => "meeting time",   :datatype => 'datetime' },
        {:name => "where",          :datatype => 'location' }]

# Create the table				
@table = @ft.create_table "My upcoming meetings", cols
@table.id #=> 42342 (the table's google id)

# Insert data
data = [{"friend name" 	=> "Eric Wimp", 
         "age"          => 25, 
         "meeting time" => Time.utc(2010,"aug",10,20,15,1),
         "where"        => "29 Acacia Road, Nuttytown"]

@table.insert data

# Note - the insert method chunks the data array into 500 row chunks

# Count data
@table.count #=> 1

# Select data
@table.select #=> data
row_ids = @table.select "ROWID"

# Update data (not working)
# @table.update row_id, {:age => 26}

# Delete data
@table.delete row_id

# Drop tables
@ft.drop @table.id                    # table id
@ft.drop [@table1.id, @table2.id]     # arrays of table ids
@ft.drop /yacht/                      # regex 
</code></pre>

h2. Fusion Tables secret Geospatial Sauce

*"Map example":http://tables.googlelabs.com/DataSource?snapid=71528*

Fusion Tables is a labs product from Google. You can "read more here":http://tables.googlelabs.com/, but the key thing is that it gives you *access to the google tile mill for ultra-fast generating of custom google map layers across massive datasets* 

Fusion Tables supports the following geometry types:

* lat/long
* addresses (automatically geocodes them for you)
* KML (point, polyline, polygon, multipolygon)

h2. Thousands of geometries rendered in near real time, integrated with google maps v3

Adding a fusion tables datalayer with many points/polygons to your v3 map is as simple as:

<pre><code>
layer = new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer(139529);
</code></pre>

That's it

You can also refine the tiles by SQL, and can even do so dynamically:

<pre><code>
layer = new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer(198945, {
  query: "SELECT address FROM 198945 WHERE ridership > 5000"}
);
</code></pre>

Finally, fusion tables also lets you make Heatmaps

<pre><code>
layer = new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer(136705, {
  heatmap: true
});
</code></pre>

You can also export your data (filtered and geocoded) to KML. As an example, here are "all the Gasoline filling stations in the UK":http://tables.googlelabs.com/exporttable?query=select+col0%2Ccol1%2Ccol2%2Ccol3%2Ccol4%2Ccol5%2Ccol6%2Ccol12%2Ccol13%2Ccol14%2Ccol15%2Ccol16%2Ccol17%2Ccol18%2Ccol19%2Ccol20%2Ccol21+from+214045+&o=kmllink&g=col0

h2. A word of warning...

# Google has a recent habit of deleting projects. This is still a labs project, and may disappear at any time
# The API is still very young and *will change* 
# Currently you have to make a table public before you can display it on a map, unfortunately, this can only be done on the web interface. A suggested workaround is to put all your data in 1 big public table, and then query for the data you want to display based off a key/flag column

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
